:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What is metagenomics?
- What are the applications of metagenomics?
- What are the advantages of using metagenomics?
- What is the difference between metagenomic profiling and genome-resolved metagenomics (MAGs)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Define metagenomics.
- Explain the difference between metagenomics and amplicon sequencing.
- Describe main approaches for metagenomic profiling.
- Explain what a “metagenome-assembled genome” (MAG) is.
- Bonus: be able to explain that to a layperson at a party!

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Metagenomics sequences all DNA, giving an unbiased, high-resolution view of community composition and function—beyond what amplicon sequencing can capture.
- Reads profiling delivers fast, reference-based taxonomic and functional counts data for downstream analyses like TaxSEA and integration workflows.
- MAGs can be reconstructed via assembly and binning of reads, revealing uncultured lineages and their metabolic potential.
- Modern sequencing and workflows (short-reads, long-reads, hybrids; nf-core pipelines) improve accuracy, assembly quality, and reproducibility.
